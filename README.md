# hello-world
Do not know exactly what I am getting myself into nor where to start really 
I love to game of all kinds and love my 2 kids, which my son is starting to get interested in programming.
Completely new to tying out anything remotely like this but am extremely interested.
I am thinking MUDs might be the best way for me to get my feet wet and get some of both worlds.
If I understand this correctly playing a MUD you delve into the world of writting script as well?
I would love to be able to eventually do projects with my son but in reality at this rate he will probably be the teacher.
I have very little skill with a computer and to be honest feel overwhelmed on where to even start with the flood of information that is out there.
Any help, info, adivse would greatly be appreciated.
